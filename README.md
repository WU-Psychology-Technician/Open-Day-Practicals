# Open-Day-Practicals

A storage of online code practicals for lecturers to grab and use whenever they wish. I will also outline some current projects that I will attempt to make so we have a good storage of things to use at any time for any student that is interested in any particular topic. We will also attempt to create to some VR/AR/XR practicals for more comprehensive practicals and also teaching tools for the department. 



## Current Development

### WUPSY VR Terminal 
- Currently developing a Virtual Reality space where you walk in a sort of airport terminal longue. However, instead of shops, restaurants, and beauty salons there will be experimental rooms, psychological demonstrations and other bits and bobs I will develop for specific disciplines in Psychology. These can have several applications from healthcare, forensic, and developmental psychology.
