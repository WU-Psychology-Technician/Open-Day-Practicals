A storage of online code practicals for lecturers to grab and use whenever they wish. I will also outline some current projects that I will attempt to make so we have a good storage of things to use at any time for any student that is interested in any particular topic. We will also attempt to create to some VR/AR/XR practicals for more comprehensive practicals and also teaching tools for the department.
